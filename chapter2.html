            <div class="reading-area">
                <p>In this world, there was a great war. We call it the War Beyond.</p>
                <p>No one knew what happened in this war; it was before all of us came into this realm.</p>
                <p>This realm was called Nod.</p>
                <p>It was a realm with an infinite number of worlds, ranging from mountains so huge they could block the sun from ever shining...</p>
                <p>Seas so deep you‚Äôd wonder if they even had a bottom...</p>
                <p>Deserts so hot it was impossible for a normal human to survive for three hours there...</p>
                <p>And forests so diverse you could never fully explore them.</p>
                <p>This is what Nod is. It sounded wonderful for adventurers. In reality, it is hell.</p>
                <p>Nod is a realm where people got transported to, to fight, to go to war...</p>
                <p>Not with other humans, but with the monsters that inhabit Nod.</p>
                <p>Humanity as a species had survived the War Beyond; however, they evolved...</p>
                <p>Gaining abilities to help them live in the hellish and barren landscape of Earth.</p>
                <p>However, Earth was dying long before the war...</p>
                <p>It was after everyone was reborn again that most of us got our powers.</p>
                <p>The process was not understood at all, but scientists were getting closer.</p>
                <p>All we knew was some people died during their rebirth, while some did not get reborn and remained human.</p>
                <p>They were dependent on those who got their powers. Thus, a hierarchy was established.</p>
